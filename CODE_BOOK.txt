Data Set Information (taken from the full description link above)
------------------------------------------------------------------
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, 
STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant 
rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating 
the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor 
acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have 
only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

UCI HAR Dataset
---------------
The dataset includes the following files:
- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

run_analysis.R process
=======================
-Read in labels files activity_labels.txt, features.txt into tables 'activity' and 'features'.
-Search 'features' using grepl to return TRUE if the label contains mean() or std() - these are the mean and standard deviation measurements from the original dataset. The results, 'colset', will be used later to subset the data.
-Read in files (X_test.txt, Y_test.txt, subject_test.txt) for test dataset using read.table. Results in tables xtest, ytest and testsubj.
-Take column names from 'xtest' and rename them from 'features'
-Add 'activity' as a column into 'ytest'
-Rename columns in ytest (subject, activity, activityCode)
-Using colset, subset the columns in 'xtest'
-Bind ytest, xtest and testsubj resulting in 'testset'
-Read in files (X_train.txt, Y_train.txt, subject_train.txt) for train dataset using read.table. Results in tables xtrain, ytrain and trainsubj.
-Take column names from 'xtrain' and rename them from 'features'
-Add 'activity' as a column into 'ytrain'
-Rename columns in ytrain (subject, activity, activityCode)
-Using colset, subset the columns in 'xtrain'
-Bind ytrain, xtrain and trainsubj resulting in 'trainset'
-Row bind testset and trainset resulting in 'dataset'
-Using names and gsub, modify column names to be more descriptive and standardize format
-Reshape dataset using melt and dcast and arrange to produce the final dataset: 'tidy_data'
